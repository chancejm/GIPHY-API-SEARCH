# GIPHYAPI-project

At start the site provides 3 sample buttons & a empty image section.

the user can click a button that will then display 10gif images in the image section.

the user can also create a new button by typing thier desired search into the input section & submitting button request.
            (that new button will function the same as the examples buttons)
            
As the images are populated they are initialy displayed as still images.

Also the Rating of the image is displayed above it.

You can activate the giphy image by simply clicking on it to "play" & clicking again to "pause".
